  <p>
    My story begins in first grade, when I was taken out of recess and placed into a
    classroom that highlighted the difference between myself and my peers.
    Learning English was difficult, but through that struggle I developed resilience.
    Over time, I came to appreciate the unique perspective it gave me. Seeing the world
    through another language taught me adaptability, patience, and persistence.
  </p>

  <p>
    Education, however, was not always easily accessible for my family. I often had to
    follow whatever path was available rather than the one I hoped for. Watching other
    students walk through opportunities I could only dream of was discouraging, but it
    also shaped how I approached challenges. I learned to recognize opportunity when it
    appeared and to commit fully when it did.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I first attended university, I realized I had taken a step that was too large,
    too quickly. I felt unprepared and behind. Instead of giving up, I stepped back,
    entered the workforce, and saved every dollar I could to return to school. That
    decision taught me discipline and reinforced the value of patience and preparation.
    When I returned, I did so with confidence and purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am now proud to be graduating with honors in a field I am passionate about:
    engineering. I am preparing to transfer to a university to continue my education in
    Computer Engineering, where I can deepen my understanding of systems that merge
    hardware and software.
  </p>

  <h2>Passion for Engineering & Robotics</h2>

  <p>
    My interest in engineering, particularly robotics, comes from the ability to turn
    ideas into real, functional systems. I enjoy working on projects where software and
    hardware interact—whether that means designing digital logic, writing low-level
    programs, or building tools that solve tangible problems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Advancing into higher education excites me because it means my projects can move
    beyond conceptual exercises and become more complex, complete, and impactful.
    Robotics represents this perfectly: it challenges me to think critically across
    disciplines while rewarding careful design and iteration.
  </p>

  <h2>Family & Motivation</h2>

  <p>
    I am the oldest of three brothers in an immigrant family. Growing up, I became aware
    early on that access to resources and opportunities is not evenly distributed.
    This awareness motivates much of what I do today.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to ensure that my brothers—and others like them—are not limited by a lack
    of options, but empowered by the choices they are able to make. Through education,
    engineering, and mentorship, I hope not only to walk through doors that once felt
    closed, but to help build new ones for those who come after me.

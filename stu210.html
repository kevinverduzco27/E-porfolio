    <p>
      This website was created as part of STU 210 to demonstrate personal,
      academic, and professional growth throughout the semester. Rather than
      focusing solely on appearance, I aimed to design a site that reflects how
      I approach problem solving, organization, and long-term planning as a
      pre-engineering student.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building this portfolio required balancing creativity with structure,
      while also managing the workload of engineering courses. The result is a
      project that represents not only my technical skills, but also my ability
      to adapt, learn, and iterate under time constraints.

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

      <p>
        As I move into the next semester, I am genuinely excited about the
        opportunities ahead. Continuing my engineering coursework means that
        the ideas I have been working on can finally become more complete, more
        complex, and more meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        STU 210 has been a pleasure to be part of. This class gave me the space to
        reflect, build, and experiment while balancing the demands of engineering
        courses. I am extremely grateful for my time at Pima Community College
        and for the opportunities it has provided me.
      </p>

      <p>
        I hope to continue taking advantage of future opportunities—academically,
        professionally, and personally—as I prepare to transfer and continue my
        education.
      </p>

      <p class="reflection-note">
        I also quickly learned that building a website from scratch in a short
        time frame—while taking engineering courses—is far more challenging than
        I initially expected. That challenge became part of the learning
        experience and reinforced the importance of planning, iteration, and
        persistence.
